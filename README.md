## Project Title
Predicting Tropical Cyclone Paths Using the Kalman Filter

## Group Members
Ezra Berg,
Liya LaPierre

## Project Description
In this project, we will be using the Kalman filter to track the path of tropical cyclones and predict the next location as the cyclone is traveling.

## File Descriptions

### hurdat2-nepac-1949-2020-043021a.txt
This file is the cyclone track path dataset "Atlantic Hurricane Database (HURDAT2)" downloaded from https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/#hurdat. 

### KalmanFilterCyclones.ipynb
This file is the main code where we clean the data above and implement the Kalman filter.
